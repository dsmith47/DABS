# Doug's Attempt at a Browser Shell

This is Doug Smith's attempt to create a series of UNIX-like commands
useful to controlling your browser functions.

## Getting Started

DABS has to be loaded into your browser as an unpacked extension, see 
[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24577024/install-chrome-extension-not-in-the-store](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24577024/install-chrome-extension-not-in-the-store)

To make DABS, you need to run `configure.sh` to produce a valid manifest.json, or use a recipe from the Makefile to run the configuration
for you.

If you're unsure of what you're doing, `make all` is the safest
choice.
